# PublicModelLibrary

This project is aimed towards making ML models easy to find and create, the goal is to create a platform where anyone can browse through models other users have made and download them with one click in their browser. Each model will have a demo and include how to run it with Python or Javascript. Additionally the aim is to create a tool where users can create their own models similarly to Google TeachableMachine or Liner.ai
